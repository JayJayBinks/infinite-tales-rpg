    *   If no, state null.`,
			`2. **New Abilities Learned ('abilities_learned'):** Has the character explicitly learned or gained access to new abilities, spells, or skills? (Examples: Read a spellbook and learned 'Fireball', trained with a master and learned 'Parry', unlocked a racial trait). Ensure the story clearly states the learning event.
    *   Do not list abilities already known: ${currentAbilitiesNames.join(', ')}
    *   If yes, describe the new ability/spell/skill.
    *   If no, empty array.`,
			`3. **Action-Restricting State ('action_restricting_state'):** Has the character entered a TEMPORARY state or condition that SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRICTS their available actions, changes how they act, or puts them under external control impacting their actions? (Examples: Put to sleep, paralyzed, charmed, blinded, under extreme duress limiting choices, affected by an illusion impacting action choice, under a compulsion spell).
    *   If yes, describe the state and its primary effect on actions.
    *   If no, state null.`,
