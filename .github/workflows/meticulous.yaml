# Workflow for serving app locally & running Meticulous tests against it

name: Meticulous

# Important: The workflow needs to run both on pushes to your main branch and on
# pull requests. It needs to run on your main branch because it'll use the results
# from the base commit of the PR on the main branch to compare against.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Important: We need the workflow to be triggered on workflow_dispatch events,
  # so that Meticulous can run the workflow on the base commit to compare
  # against if an existing workflow hasn't run
  workflow_dispatch: {}

# Important: The workflow needs all the permissions below.
# These permissions are mainly need to post and update the status check and
# feedback comment on your PR. Meticulous wonâ€™t work without them.

        # We strongly recommend you serve the app with a non-development server.
        # For instance, if you are using Vite, use 'vite preview' instead of 'vite'
        # or 'vite serve' to spin up the app.
        # The sleep is often required to ensure your app is readily being served
